# 📸 Face-Sorted Image Viewer

A lightweight, scalable frontend application to explore large image libraries
that have been automatically grouped by identity using face detection and clustering.

This app displays images stored in a Google Drive folder and organizes them
using a precomputed face clustering output (`face_directory.pkl`).

Built with **Streamlit** and designed for **GitHub + Streamlit Cloud deployment**.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Modern image collections grow rapidly — wedding albums, media archives,
machine learning datasets — and manually organizing them by people
does not scale.

This project provides a simple frontend to **browse identity-based clusters**
generated by an offline face-sorting pipeline, without requiring
manual labeling or predefined identities.

## ⚙️ What This App Does

- Displays images from a Google Drive folder
- Groups images by detected identity (person_1, person_2, …)
- Handles large datasets efficiently
- Provides a visual face lookup guide for non-technical users
- Requires no backend server

---

## 📂 Output Structure (Logical)
person_1 → [img1, img2, img3, ...]
person_2 → [img4, img7, ...]
no_person → [...]

The app consumes this structure from a serialized file:
`face_directory.pkl`.

## 🧠 Key Design Choices

- **No manual labeling**
- **No predefined number of people**
- **Google Drive as image storage**
- **Streamlit for fast deployment**
- **Service account authentication (secure & scalable)**
