# 📸 Face-Sorted Image Viewer

A lightweight, scalable frontend application to explore large image libraries
that have been automatically grouped by identity using face detection and clustering.

This app displays images stored in a Google Drive folder and organizes them
using a precomputed face clustering output (`face_directory.pkl`).

Built with **Streamlit** and designed for **GitHub + Streamlit Cloud deployment**.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Modern image collections grow rapidly — wedding albums, media archives,
machine learning datasets — and manually organizing them by people
does not scale.

This project provides a simple frontend to **browse identity-based clusters**
generated by an offline face-sorting pipeline, without requiring
manual labeling or predefined identities.
